# NFT preview card üíé‚ú®
# Front-end challenge with HTML and CSS

This is my solution to the NFT card component Front-end mentor's challenge. This HTML & CSS only challenge is perfect for anyone just starting out or anyone wanting a small project to play around with.

## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
We can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if we've got something we'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

Ideas to test ourself :

- Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or Stylus
- Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 


### What I learned

This is my first front-end challenge. I'm not use to Sass yet, so I wasn't able to use any CSS pre-processor. I learned how to use a FIGMA file, which is really important as a front-end dev.
